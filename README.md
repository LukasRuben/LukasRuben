## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Lukas, a computer science student at [HHU](https://www.cs.hhu.de/).
- ğŸ’» I'm currently working on a reverb VST. Ask me about it!
- ğŸ“š I'm most experienced with Flask / Python
- ğŸ”­ I'm interested in robotics, but I have much to learn

My public repositories are not for use (so far). They're a way for possible employers to get a glimpse into my knowledge and my work.
