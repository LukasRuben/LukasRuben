## Hi there 👋

I'm Lukas, a computer science student at [HHU](https://www.cs.hhu.de/).
- 💻 I'm currently working on a reverb VST. Ask me about it!
- 📚 I'm most experienced with Flask / Python
- 🔭 I'm interested in robotics, but I have much to learn

My public repositories are not for use (so far). They're a way for possible employers to get a glimpse into my knowledge and my work.
